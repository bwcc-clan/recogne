# RCON Server for Hell Let Loose

An RCON server for Hell Let Loose, with bells.

## Overview

Recogne is a SPA based around a Python [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) backend and a React/Typescript frontend
with a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) development environment.

## Why Recogne?

[Recogne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recogne) is a village in Belgium near
[Bastogne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastogne). It hosts a [German war
cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recogne_German_war_cemetery) where 6,807 WW2 soldiers are buried. And it
half-rhymes with RCON, kind of.
